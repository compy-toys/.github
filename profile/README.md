# Compy

A console-based Lua-programmable computer for children based on
[LÖVE2D][löve2d] framework.

## Principles

- Command-line based UI
- Full control over each pixel of the display
- Ability to easily reset to initial state
- Impossible to damage with non-violent interaction
- Syntactic mistakes caught early, not accepted on input
- Possibility to test/try parts of program separately
- Share software in source package form
- Minimize frustration

### Trying it out

Development is going on in [this][dev] repo, you can find builds
[there][releases] for now, until an official release is completed from
