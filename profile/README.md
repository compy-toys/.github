- Full control over each pixel of the display
- Ability to easily reset to initial state
- Impossible to damage with non-violent interaction
- Syntactic mistakes caught early, not accepted on input
- Possibility to test/try parts of program separately
- Share software in source package form
- Minimize frustration
